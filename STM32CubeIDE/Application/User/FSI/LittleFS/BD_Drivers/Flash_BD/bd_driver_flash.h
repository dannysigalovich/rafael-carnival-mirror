 * 	@brief 	Block Device (Embedded Flash) driver - Header File
 *	-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
 *		Block device is storage device that supports reading and writing data in fixed-size
 *	blocks. Blocks size is generally 512 bytes or multiple of this size. It is important to
 *	mention that block device can be programmed with data size less than block size, and also
 *	data, which size is less than block size, can be read from block device. But, in order to
 *	delete  data from block storage device, which size is less than block size, erase process
 *	must be conducted  on the entire block. That means  if file  system wont to delete, for
 *	example file name which use only 12 bytes, it must erase entire block which minimum size
 *	is 512Bytes. So,  it is  important  to consider  this fact when using file system on MCU
 *	Embedded FLash Memory. In case  of LittleFs (and generally any other File system)  it is
 *	important  that  MCU Embedded flash memory  be organized  as block  storage device which
 *	maximum block (page) size is not bigger than 4KB and number of block should  not  be less
 *	than 256.
 *		In this file  are defined all  functions which is used to interface with block device.
 *	Embedded flash memory used with this functions is STML476RG MCU Flash memory. In order to
 *	access  these memory to write to and to read from  it, STM FLASH HAL Driver functions are
 *	used. IF user wont to  use these project with  some other type of memory, for example SPI
 *	flash, he must to implements his own block device function. In that case, functions defined
 *	in this file can be used as example how to properly implement that functions
